Trimming and quality evaluation of your sequences
=================================================

Start at the EC2 login prompt.  Then, ::

  cd /mnt

Make a directory to store all your trimmed data in, and go there::

  mkdir trim
  cd trim

Now, run 'Trimmomatic' to eliminate Illumina adapters -- ::

  java -jar /usr/local/bin/trimmomatic-0.27.jar PE ../ecoli_ref-5m_s1.fq.gz ../ecoli_ref-5m_s2.fq.gz s1_pe s1_se s2_pe s2_se ILLUMINACLIP:../illuminaClipping.fa:2:30:10

Next, let's take a look at data quality using FastQC::

   mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc
   /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc s1_* s2_* --outdir=/root/Dropbox/fastqc

This will dump the FastQC output into your Dropbox folder, under
the folder 'fastqc'.  Go check it out -- you're looking for folders
named <filename>_fastqc, for example 's1_pe_fastqc'; then double
click on 'fastqc_report.html'.

It looks like a lot of bad data is present after base 70, so let's just trim
all the sequences that way.  Before we do that, we want to interleave the
reads again (don't ask) -- ::

   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/interleave.py s1_pe s2_pe > combined.fq

Now, let's use the FASTX toolkit to trim off bases over 70, and
eliminate low-quality sequences.  We need to do this both for our
combined/paired files and our remaining single-ended files::

   fastx_trimmer -Q33 -l 70 -i combined.fq | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > combined-trim.fq

   fastx_trimmer -Q33 -l 70 -i s1_se | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > s1_se.filt

Let's take a look at what we have -- ::

   ls -la

.. @@

Let's run FastQC on things again, too::

   mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc.filt
   /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc combined-trim.fq s1_se.filt --outdir=/root/Dropbox/fastqc.filt

Now go look in your Dropbox folder under 'fastqc.filt', folder
'combined-trim.fq_fastqc' -- looks a lot better, eh?
