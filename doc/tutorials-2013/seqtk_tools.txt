SeqTK Tools
===========

seqtk: trim and process reads at insanely high speed - brought to you
by the Church of Heng Li

https://github.com/lh3/seqtk

For just about all tools the input can be fasta, fastq file, may be
gzipped or not, will unzip on the fly.

Installation
------------

    # download with github
    git clone git://github.com/lh3/seqtk.git
    cd seqtk
    make
    cp seqtk /usr/local/bin

We will use e.coli data in snapshot snap-000d346e in this tutorials.
Create a volume from the snapshot and attach it to the instance.::

    mkdir /ebs/
    mount /dev/xvdf /ebs

Tools
-----

    cd /mnt

To see a list of tools::

    seqtk

Extracts a random sample::

    # sample 1000 reads from a fastq file
    seqtk sample /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz 1000 > SRR001666_1_1000.fastq 

Convert fastq to fasta::

    seqtk seq -A /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz > sample.fa

Apply a seed to extract the same reads from two, paired end files::

    seqtk sample -s 10 /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz 1000 > SRR001666_1_1000.fastq 
    seqtk sample -s 10 /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_2.fastq.gz 1000 > SRR001666_2_1000.fastq 

Trim reads with the modified Mott trimming algorithm::

    # trim with default error threshold = 0.05
    seqtk trimfq /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz > timmed.fq

    # trim with an error threshold = 0.01
    seqtk trimfq -q 0.01 /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz > timmed.fq

    # trim the first 3 bases and the last 5 bases
    seqtk trimfq -b 3 -e 5 /ebs/ecoli/SRR001666_1.fastq.gz > timmed.fq

The algorithm is described on this page, find the section Algorithm for details:

Beyond these there are other interesting features - you can subtract
subsequences from file (say you want to extract a certain part of your
reference genome) etc.
