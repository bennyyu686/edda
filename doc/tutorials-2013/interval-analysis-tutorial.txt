Requirements
-------------

Install Bedtools::

    # go to the code installation directory
    cd /mnt
    
    # download the code
    wget https://bedtools.googlecode.com/files/BEDTools.v2.17.0.tar.gz
    
    # unpack it
    tar zxvf BEDTools.v2.17.0.tar.gz
    
    # move into the tool folder
    cd bedtools-2.17.0/
    
    # compile the program
    make
    
    # copy the program to be universally accessible
    cp bin/bedtools /usr/local/bin/
    
Prepare the Dropbox work folders::

    # this will switch back to
    # the home directory
    cd
    
    # create a new work directory
    mkdir Dropbox/intervals
    
    # switch to that directory
    cd Dropbox/intervals

You can now create files on your local Dropbox folder and once the file are
saved they will appear on the remote (Amazon cloud) computer.

With the editor of your choice create a fasta/fastq file in your Dropbox folder that contains the following:

1. an exact subsequence from the drosophila genome 
2. a subsequence from the drosophila genome with one mismatch (or any other variation)
3. a spliced junction file

Now the pipeline to generate a mapping file will look like this. You can also put this into
a separate file and re-run it via the shell command::

    # align the reads
    bwa aln /mnt/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta read1.fq > read1.sai
        
    # format the alignment as a SAM file
    bwa samse /mnt/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta read1.sai read1.fq > temp.sam
    
    # convert sam to bam format, then sort and index it
    samtools view -Sb temp.sam > temp.bam
    samtools sort -f temp.bam read1.bam
    samtools index read1.bam
    
    # delete the temporary SAM files
    #rm temp.sam temp.bam
    
    # display the SAM file with the header
    samtools view -h read1.bam

Add other sequences, modify the input, verify and study the output.
Understanding the SAM format is an fundamental requirement for most applications.

Novelty: The bwa MEM (Maximal Exact Matches) algorithm can produce local
maximal alignments. Modify your query sequence to the extent that
the normal aln method does not match then try the MEM method::

    bwa mem /mnt/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta read1.fa > results.sam
  
(it can do spliced alignments!)

Now let's investigate your previous drosophila SAM file. First link it into the current
folder. This creates a shortcut::

    # create a symbolic link (shortcut) to the file
    ln -s /mnt/RAL357_bwa.sorted.bam ral.bam
    
    # index the file
    samtools index ral.bam
    
    # view your file
    samtools view ral.bam | more
    
SamTools is a phenomenal tool that allows one to filter and view any part of
the file at very high speeds, this shows only the region of 1-10000 of the XHet
chromosome::

    samtools view ral.bam XHet:1-10000
    
Counting how much data falls in a certain range is so common it has its own flag, -c ::

    samtools view -c ral.bam XHet:1-10000

Filtering by flags at: http://picard.sourceforge.net/explain-flags.html

The ``-f`` flag keeps reads with a certain property, the ``-F`` flag removes reads
with a certain property.

Task: find out if the for chromosome 2R and the first one million
bases the number of reads on the positive strand are reasonably
equal to the number of reads on the negative strand.
    

Interval Operations
===================

Visit the FlyBase http://flybase.org/ and download the gene annotations for the
drosphila genome as a GFF file and put it into your Dropbox folder::

    # download a single annotation file
    wget ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/current/gff/dmel-3RHet-r5.51.gff.gz

    # decompress the file that was downloaded
    gunzip dmel-3RHet-r5.51.gff.gz
    
    # count the number of line in the file
    wc -l dmel-3RHet-r5.51.gff 
    
    # this file contains all annotations but we want to filter
    # for lines that are annotated as gene
    # but we can't just directly match for the word gene as this
    # word may be present in other context
    # we need to search for lines that match
    # the word FlyBase \tab gene
    # below the capital \W indicates a whitespace character
    
    grep -E 'FlyBase\Wgene' dmel-3RHet-r5.51.gff > genes.gff
    
Previously we have created a SAM alignment file and you can now
have combine it with genes via the bedtools::

    bedtools intersect -a ral.bed -b genes.gff -wo > results.txt
