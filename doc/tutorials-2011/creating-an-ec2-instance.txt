Introducing Amazon EC2
----------------------

Amazon EC2 -- EC2 stands for "Elastic Cloud Computing" -- is a service
by which Amazon rents you a remote computer on an hourly basis. The
only access to this computer is over the network (which is why we
covered `ssh and scp <unix-and-ssh-and-scp.html>`_ first, because that's
how you have to interact with EC2 systems).

Setting up an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amazon provides a lot of services through what it calls "Amazon Web
Services".  To get started, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and sign
up for an account; it can be linked to your Amazon account.

Once you have an AWS account, sign up for Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2).

You'll need to provide a credit card to pay for your default account
use, but (if you're doing this as part of the NGS or BEACON courses) the
course can pay for your AWS usage during the course.

Log in to Amazon Web Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/.

"Sign in to the AWS Management Console".  (You'll need to sign up for
an account if you haven't already done so; it's separate from your
regular Amazon account.)

Enter your username and password, etc.

Ask Amazon to start a new computer up for you
---------------------------------------------

You should now see the "Amazon EC2 Console Dashboard".  Click on
"Launch Instance".

Now, you'll see a 'request instances wizard' window next.  This will
give you the option of selecting what *kind* of operating system you
want running on the computer.

Select the "Community AMIs" tab.

Next to "Viewing all images", enter "ami-ea837b83" (this might be a
good place to copy/paste...) and hit "return".  You should see one
entry, containing the text 'ged.msu.edu/angus-64bit-2011.06.02-b/image.manifest.xml' with platform "Other Linux".  Select it (button on the right).

The next screen lets you specify a bunch of stuff -- "Number of instances",
or, number of computers to start up; "Availability zone", or the region
where you want this to be started; and "Instance type", the size and
speed of the computer.  Leave these all as default, and click Continue.

The next screen, "Advanced Instance Options", gives you additional ways
to customize the computer.  Just leave everything as default and select
"Continue".

The next screen, "create key pair", lets you tell Amazon who has access
to your machine.

The private keyfile will be automatically downloaded and placed on your
machine; this will depend on where your Web browser places files.  We'll
need it later, so you should track it down :)

Next, you'll have to define security settings.

You'll need to allow SSH connections in by "adding a rule" for SSH:

Finally, at the Review screen, you can see a summary -- just click
"Launch".

Now you should see a screen that says "your instances are now launching".
Click "View your instances on the Instances page".

Hooray!

Important note: shutting down your instance
-------------------------------------------

When you're not using your rented system, you should shut it off.  Amazon
only charges you for the periods that your system is up.

You can turn it off in *either* of two ways:

First, log in to your system and type 'shutdown -h now'.

Or, second, on the main EC2 instance screen, select the instance you
want to turn off, and click on "instance actions", and then select
"Terminate".

**Important!** After shutting down or terminating your instance, you
should always go refresh the EC2 tab at http://aws.amazon.com/ to make
sure it's off!

A few notes
-----------

You only need to set up the key file and network groups once; then
you can reuse them.

A couple of caveats
-------------------

The main caveat is this: Amazon is charging you while your instances
are running!  For now, they're just charging *me* (or this course,
really) -- but once you're done with this class, they'll be charging
*you*.  So make sure you shut down your computers when you're done with them!

Another caveat is that each time you start or stop an instance, you lose
all of the data there.    We'll talk about how to deal with that later;
for now, accept it as part of the challenge.
