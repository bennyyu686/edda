=============
BEACON Course
=============

These are materials for the 2010 `BEACON <http://www.beacon.msu.edu>`__ course,
`CSE 891 s002: Computational Science for Evolutionary Biologists <http://ged.msu.edu/courses/2010-fall-cse-891/>`__.

Rather than developing a whole new site containing a lot of
overlapping material, we'll be integrating some BEACON material into
the `ANGUS site <http://ged.msu.edu/angus/>`__.

Lecture Links
=============

Lecture 2 -- Intro to cloud computing and avida
-----------------------------------------------

(Sep 10th, 2010)

In class, we worked through
:doc:`../tutorials/starting-your-cloud-system` and
:doc:`building-and-running-avida`.

You may find the :doc:`../aws-cheat-sheet` useful later on.

Lecture 4 -- Effective remote computer use (stage 1)
----------------------------------------------------

(Sep 17th, 2010)

Just a reminder -- you can *always* Google it, and the worst that will
happen is you lose some data (which you can cleverly save by
transferring it to your laptop, if it's small enough!)

In class, we'll work through the following tutorials:

 * :doc:`../tutorials/unix-directories-and-files`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/setting-up-an-ebs-volume`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/using-the-nano-editor`
 * Running jobs while you sleep: the 'screen' section of :doc:`../unix-cheat-sheet`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/using-top`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/setting-a-password`
 * Transferring files:
    - Windows: the Notepad++ and WinSCP sections of :doc:`../tutorials/using-putty-on-windows`
    - Mac OS X: :doc:`../tutorials/using-ssh-scp-terminal-macosx`

and finally we'll go through :doc:`running-avida-longer`.
