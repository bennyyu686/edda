Downloading and installing Bowtie and BLAST
===========================================

You've now worked with pre-installed software (like ipython notebook),
and also worked with software that we have to build and install
ourselves (like Velvet, screed, and khmer).  There's another category:
software that is already built, but that we need to download and install.
It's simpler than compiling it; it's just a matter of downloading,
unpacking, and copying the files around.

Here are two examples: `bowtie
<http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml>`__, a read mapping
packge, ::

   %% cd /mnt
   %% curl -O -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
   %% unzip bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
   %% cp bowtie-0.12.7/bowtie* /usr/local/bin

and BLAST, which I'm hoping most of you have already had some
experience with::

   %% curl -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.24/blast-2.2.24-ia32-linux.tar.gz
   %% tar xzf blast-2.2.24-ia32-linux.tar.gz
   %% cp blast-2.2.24/bin/* /usr/local/bin
   %% cp -r blast-2.2.24/data /usr/local/blast-data

In both cases we're simply grabbing binary packages that already exist
for our platform -- you sort of learn to recognize things like
'x86_64', which means 'binary for x86 processors (most of them),
64-bit versions (the more recent ones)'.  'ia32' in the BLAST name
means '32-bit or above Intel architectures (which is pretty much all
of them)'.

Also, please install Dropbox
