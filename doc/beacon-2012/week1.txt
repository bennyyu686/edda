Week 1 - Introducing Amazon, iPython notebook, and Python
=========================================================

Introduction and resources
--------------------------

We'll be using Python 2, running inside IPython Notebook, on Amazon
rental machines, for the first few weeks of this class.

Python 2 is different from Python 3, note.

Here are some resources for you to use if you are interested in exploring on
your own:

 - `Software Carpentry site <http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/python/>`__

 - `The official Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`__

 - `MIT's A Gentle Introduction to Programming <http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2008/>`__

Homework 1
----------

Due Sunday, September 9th, at midnight PST.

After going through the lectures above, start up an EC2 instance, and:

1. create a new notebook, and write three bits of code, each in a
   separate cell:

   a. a while loop that creates a list containing every 3rd number starting
      at 2 and ending with the number N, but excluding those numbers
      that are divisible by 10.  For example, if N is 21, then the
      list would contain 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17.  Put the list in
      a variable named 'triads'.

   b. a while loop that creates a list of prime numbers between 2 and N.
      Put the list in a variable named 'primes'.

   c. a for loop that creates a list of squared numbers from the odd
      numbers between 1 and N, and puts the list in a variable named
      'oddsquared'.  For example, if N is 6, then the 'oddsquared'
      list would contain 1, 9, and 25 (1, 3, and 5, squared).

   In all three cases, 'N' should be something you can set arbitrarily,
   e.g. the code should work equally well for N=10 and N=100.

2. create a new notebook, and go through the entire Software Carpentry
`string tutorial
<http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/python/strings/>`__ in the
notebook.  Put all of the working examples in the notebook and make
sure they function as expected (and as demonstrated in the tutorial).

Save both notebooks, download them to your laptop, and send them to Titus
at <ctb@msu.edu>.  Remember to shut down your EC2 instance!
