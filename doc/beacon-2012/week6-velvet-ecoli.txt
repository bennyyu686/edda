Running the Velvet assembler on an E. coli data set
===================================================

After logging in via Terminal and ssh (on the Mac) or via puttygen (on
Windows), you should be at a prompt that looks something like this::

  root@ip-10-10-65-136:~#

This is a UNIX command prompt.  Enter all of the commands *after* the %%s,
below, to tell your remote computer what to do.

---



Go to a directory with lots of disk space::

  %% cd /mnt

Grab some test data from one of my publications::

  %% curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz

Now, uncompress the file::

  %% gunzip ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz

If you ask for a detailed file listing of it, you'll see that it's
about 1.1 GB in size::

  %% ls -la ecoli_ref-5m.fastq 
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1141494078 2012-10-10 02:17 ecoli_ref-5m.fastq

Now, look at the top of the file::

  %% head ecoli_ref-5m.fastq

(This just prints out the first 10 lines.)

Check out the format -- this is a FASTQ file for storing short read data.
Each record is four lines: the first line, starting with @, is the
sequence name; the second line is the sequence; the third line is a '+';
and the fourth line is quality information about each of the bases in the
sequence.

This file contains 5m reads from an Illumina run on E. coli, taken
from the Chitsaz et al. (2011) single-cell paper (see
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926975).

----

Next, grab the source code for the Velvet assembler::

  %% curl -O http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/velvet_1.2.08.tgz

Unpack it::

  %% tar xvzf velvet_1.2.08.tgz

And build it::

  %% cd velvet_1.2.08
  %% make MAXKMERLENGTH='51'

Finally, install it in a central location::

  %% cp velvetg velveth /usr/local/bin

----

OK.  We've got the data, and we've got the assembler.  Now what?

Assemble!

Assembly with velvet consists of two commands: first, the command
velveth, which creates a graph file that stores all the reads;
and second, the command velvetg, which traverses the graph and outputs
an assembled genome. ::

  %% cd /mnt
  %% velveth ecoli.33 33 -short -fastq ecoli_ref-5m.fastq 

(This will take a few minutes.)  Here, you're telling the 'velveth'
program that you want to create an assemble in the directory
'ecoli.33', with a k-mer value of 33, using the sequences in the
short-read FASTQ file 'ecoli_ref-5m.fastq'.

Once this is done, now run 'velvetg' to actually build an assembly::

  %% velvetg ecoli.33

This, too, will take a few minutes.

The kind of output you see is typical of UNIX analysis commands: a bunch
of semi-cryptic text output that alerts you that the program is running,
but doesn't mean that much. If you do this enough, you'll start to
be able to interpret it... which is kind of scary.  But the main thing is,
there's no standard output format, so each program will spit out something
different.  Basically... get used to it :).

OK, once all this finishes, if you type 'ls' you'll see a list of files,
which includes a directory 'ecoli.33'. ::

  %% ls
  ecoli.33  ecoli_ref-5m.fastq  lost+found  velvet_1.2.08  velvet_1.2.08.tgz

If you look in that directory, ::

  %% ls ecoli.33/
  Graph  LastGraph  Log  PreGraph  Roadmaps  Sequences  contigs.fa  stats.txt

you'll see a bunch of files which includes 'contigs.fa'.  That contains
your assembled contigs.  Check it out with 'head'::

  %% head ecoli.33/contigs.fa
  >NODE_1_length_49_cov_1.020408
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTGGCAGAAGAAAAATAAGAAATGTTACAAAAAA
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >NODE_66_length_56_cov_1.107143
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAAGGGCAAAGCAAAATAAAAAGTTTTT
  CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >NODE_121_length_33_cov_1.000000
  AAAAAAAAAAAAACATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATACTATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  AAAAA
  >NODE_124_length_54_cov_1.055556

You should see something like the above, with a bunch of FASTA sequences.
These are your assembled contigs.  Many of them are short and rather
crappy :).  We'll talk about this in class on Monday.

In the meantime, open up the IPython Notebook via your browser, as you
usually do.  Create a new notebook, and enter these four commands into it::

  !ls /mnt
  !ls /mnt/ecoli.33
  !cp /mnt/ecoli.33/contigs.fa /root/Dropbox
  !head -50 /mnt/ecoli.33/contigs.fa

Save that notebook as 'hw6.ipynb', put it in a gist, and send me the
gist ID; then, shut down your computer.

Note that you should also now have a ~5mb file named 'contigs.fa' in
your Dropbox directory on your local computer.
