Week 7 - More assembly; k-mers
==============================

Reminder: a k-mer is just a fixed length word of DNA.  Re-read the Miller
paper sections on de Bruijn graphs if you need reminding!

Homework 7
----------

Start up a small instance.

Go through the instructions in :doc:`week7-khmer`; then:

1. Connect to the ipython notebook server, read update the notebooks,
   and read through hw-week7-fake-genome.  Answer the questions at the
   end.

2. Also, fill in code for Problems 1 and 2 in the notebook
   'hw-week7-data-parsing-again'.

Upload both sets of answers as gists and make sure they work on
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/.  Send your gist IDs to Titus at
