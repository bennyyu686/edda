Homework 5
----------

Hand in the below as separate gists, in notebook form (as for HW 3 and
4).  Note, all of the pre-cooked notebooks are available when you
update your notebooks.

1. Penny the Porpoise, round 2.

   Go find the IPython notebook entitled 'hw-week5-penny2' (source `here <https://raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-penny2.ipynb>`__, HTML `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-penny2.ipynb>`__) and follow instructions.

2. Heterogenous lists in dicts.

   Create a notebook that grabs the CSV data in
   https://raw.github.com/ctb/edda/master/doc/beacon-2011/tutorial5/short.csv
   (see problem #1) and loads the data into a single dictionary keyed
   on the names and with lists of the per-name info as values.  Then
   iterate through the dictionary and print out the gender and jacket
   color of every female under the age of 15.

3. Coin flipping, round 1.

   Go find the IPython notebook entitled 'hw-week5-coinflips (source `here <https://raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-coinflips.ipynb>`__, HTML `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-coinflips.ipynb>`__) and follow instructions.

4. Coin flipping, round 2.

   Go find the IPython notebook entitled 'hw-week5-coinflips2 (source `here <https://raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-coinflips2.ipynb>`__, HTML `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/intro-computational-science/master/hw-week5-coinflips2.ipynb>`__) and follow instructions.
