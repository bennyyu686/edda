Week 6 - UNIX and assembly with velvet
======================================

Reading & Pondering
-------------------

For class on Monday, please read: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211242

Ponder the following questions and choose your three favorite (most reliable)
answers... we'll rank and discuss them in class.

1. Given an assembly for which we have a nearby (but not identical)
reference genome, how do we evaluate the assembly?

2. Given an assembly *without* a nearby reference genome, how can we evaluate
the assembly?

Instructions
------------

Make sure you have Dropbox (http://www.dropbox.com) installed and
running on your machine.  Here's an invitation that you can use:

Here's a video run through of the homework, below: `Assembling E. coli with Velvet on EC2 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1mps9h_ov0&feature=youtu.be>`__.

Homework 6
----------

Follow the instructions in
:doc:`../tutorials-2012/start-up-an-ec2-instance` and either
:doc:`../tutorials-2012/log-in-with-ssh-mac` or
:doc:`../tutorials-2012/log-in-with-ssh-win`.  (You'll want to
continue using the AMI ami-c17ec8a8, rather than the one in the
linked-to instructions.)

After logging in, install Dropbox on the remote machine by following this
tutorial: :doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`.

Finally, go through the instructions in :doc:`week6-velvet-ecoli`; make
sure to follow all the way through the homework at the end!
