Week 8 - Even more assembly; mapping and BLAST
==============================================

Note: I estimate this homework should take at least 2 hours in front
of the computer in one sitting, just to do the assembly stuff.

Homework 8
----------

Start up a medium instance -- something with at least 3.7 GB of RAM.

Go through the instructions in :doc:`week6-velvet-ecoli`,
:doc:`week7-khmer` and :doc:`week8-install`.  (You should now have
Velvet, khmer, screed, bowtie, and BLAST installed! It's gonna be a
fun week!)

Then:

1. Run Velvet with k set to 31 by adapting the velveth and velvetg
   commands in :doc:`week6-velvet-ecoli` (it's as simple as replacing
   '33' with '31' in three different spots when running velveth and
   velvetg).

2. Connect to the ipython notebook server, update the notebooks,
   and run & read through 'hw-week8-which-k'.  Answer the questions
   at the end.

3. Separately, work through 'hw-week8-moar-data-parsing'.

Upload both sets of answers as gists and make sure they work on
