Homework 1
----------

Due Sunday, September 16th, at midnight PST.

After going through the lectures above, start up an EC2 instance, and:

1. create a new notebook, 'homework2-lastname', and write the following bits
   of code, each in a separate cell:

   a. Write a function 'volume' that returns the volume of a sphere for a
      given radius.  Note: volume = (2/3 * pi * r**3)

   b. Write a function 'triple' that takes a list as an argument and returns
      a *new* list that contains every element in the given list 3 times in
      a row.  For example, 'triple([5, 6, 7])' should return
      '[5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7]'.  Avoid side effects.

   c. Write a function 'uniq' that takes a list as an argument and returns
      a new list that contains only the unique elements of that list, e.g.
      'uniq([5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9])' should return [5, 7, 8, 9].  Avoid side
      effects.

      Hint: remember that you can use the operator 'in' to see if an element
      is already in a list.

   d. Write a function 'uniq_nocase' that takes a list of strings as
      an argument and returns a new list that contains only the unique
      strings in the input list, all lower case.  "Unique" here means
      unique in their lowercase form,
      e.g. 'uniq_nocase(["A", "a", "b"])' should return ["a", "b"].

2. watch the `prime number video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYnozJnJFI&feature=youtu.be>`__ and do what it says.

   Specifically,

    - update your notebooks using 'course-00-update-notebooks'

    - open 'course-02-primes-hw'

    - copy the 'primes' function into a new cell and edit it to make a
      new function that returns a list of prime numbers, rather than
      print them out.

    - copy the 'primes' function again and edit it to use the 'sieve'
      approach (see `the Wikipedia page for Eratosthenes
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Prime_numbers>`__).

3. Save and download your notebooks, and e-mail them to Titus at
   <ctb@msu.edu>.  Feel free to CC Art Covert <covertar@gmail.com>.

4. Remember to shut down your instance!
