How to copy things to and from your local computer
==================================================

It used to be annoying to copy things back and forth from remote EC2 instances
to your laptop.  Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) has solved this problem for you!

If you go through the dropbox ipython notebook (ngs-01-install-dropbox) you
can link the directory '/root/Dropbox' to your dropbox account.

To copy things FROM dropbox out onto the EC2 machine, do::

  %% cp /root/Dropbox/filename.txt /mnt

(We'll discuss directory paths over the next few days.)
To copy things TO dropbox FROM the EC2 machine, do::

  %% cp /path/to/file /root/Dropbox

I would generally suggest avoiding using Dropbox to transfer files that
are more than ~100mb in size.

Note, you can see what's in Dropbox on your EC2 machine by doing ::

  %% ls /root/Dropbox/

at either the shell, or in the ipython notebook.
