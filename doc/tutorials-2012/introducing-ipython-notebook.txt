Introducing ipython notebook
============================

ipython notebook is something that we're trying out for the first time.

Briefly, connect into your machine by using 'https://' plus your
machine name, and accept the "broken certificate" message.

Now you're at the ipython notebook console.

Here, you can select existing notebooks, or create new ones.  These notebooks
intermingle code and results, and serve as a log of what you've been doing.

The rules within a notebook are pretty straightforward: shift-ENTER will
"execute" a snippet of code, or a cell.  When you see [*], that means
it's running.  And output should show up!

By default, ipython notebook assumes you're writing Python code.
You can also run shell commands ('%%' in the tutorial) with '!'
in the ipython notebook.

You can download ipynbs files, and also drag and drop new ones from
your file system onto the list.

If this works out, we'll be using ipython notebook for running most things...
we'll see tomorrow!
