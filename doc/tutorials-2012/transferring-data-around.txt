Transferring data around
========================

Here's a command for *creating* a tar file::

   %% tar czf output.tar.gz <one or more files or directories>

You can copy files between UNIX servers using 'scp', which uses the
ssh protocol as a way to copy files.  One challenge is that EC2
instances by default don't have any passwords; you have to use keys.

For Mac OS X, you can use Fugu to grab large files via the SSH connection;

For Windows, WinSCP might work well: http://winscp.net/eng/index.php
