Useful Web Sites
================

Our goal with this course is to "teach you to fish", not to give you fish.
Part of learning to fish is to figure out *where to fish*.  So here goes.

First rule of the Web: Use Google to search for keywords and you'll
generally find what you want, if it's available online!  That having
been said, here are some specific sites that you might find interesting
and useful.

Bioinformatics sites
====================

I think these two sites are probably the most useful bioinformatics specific
sites:

    http://seqanswers.com/ - SEQanswers, all about next-gen sequencing

    http://biostars.org/ - BioStar, a Q&A site where you can find answers, and
    ask questions.

Programming sites for scientists
================================

Software Carpentry is a concept and set of materials dedicated to
"computational scientist" education.
