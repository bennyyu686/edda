For today,

1. Create a new instance, or start up an old one using the current AMI.

2. Connect to ipython notebook and run the 'ngs-00-update-notebooks' nb.

3. Quit that, and then run 'ngs-02-install-screed' and 'ngs-03-install-khmer'.

4. Now open 'ngs-41-velvet-genome-assembly'.

We'll also work through 'ngs-42-oases-mRNAseq-assembly' and
'ngs-43-trinity-mRNAseq-assembly'.  Trinity will take an hour or more,
note.
